# 40ServantsBot for Discord

40ServantsBot is a divination Discord bot (for fun, not actual fortune telling). You send it the command '+40Scard' and it returns a card. The cards are from Tommie Kelly's Forty Servants deck.

## Setup

If you want to invite 40ServantsBot to your existing server, just point your browser at https://discord.com/api/oauth2/authorize?client_id=812696812136955934&permissions=2147485696&scope=bot%20applications.commands .

## Usage

In the Discord server running 40ServantsBot, type:

```
/40s
```

A random card's image and meaning will be returned to the channel, along with a link for more card details.

You can also send a DM to the bot, just like you would DM any other Discord user, and it will return your card privately.

## Notes

Tommie Kelly was nice enough to allow me to use his deck for this. If you like the art, you can buy a physical or digital deck from http://thefortyservants.com .
